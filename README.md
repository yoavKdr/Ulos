# project Ulos

//The preparations
Ulos it's short for "Useless operating system".
The first thing I did was to learn what OS is, what it does and what are the requirements to make one.
Then in the next 1.2 months all I did was to learned c++,c and assembly (first mistake).
After I finished learning all the basic information I started... looking on the screen and asked myself "what now".
Time passed and I found a good tutorial for beginners like me (from that tutorial I understood that i've bin screwed).
2 week later: I got 0 storage on my pc (with the help of Visual Studio), hatred for assmbly and all the preparations done 
I STARTED FOR REAL.

//Start coding
In the beginning I made boot loader with asm and thought: from now on, everything will be easy (second mistake).
I managed to print "Hello World!", and of course after that big success I wanted to make a command line in my OS,
and only then I understood that I can't make it in just 512 poor bytes,
so i stared working on the abillity to read the disk and extended the correct storage.
Im still not sure why but its really hard to run C code on 16 bytes OS so...
With hard work and the power of google I did it! my OS was 32 byte.
